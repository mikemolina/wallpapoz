About
--------------------------------------------------------------------------
Wallpapoz application enables you to configure Gnome and XFCE desktop wallpapers
in unique way. You could have Gnome and XFCE desktop wallpaper changes when 
the specified time has passed. The most important feature is you could 
have Gnome and XFCE desktop wallpaper changes when you change workspace. It means 
you could group your wallpapers into specific workspace. It offers
quick orientation cues where you are. You can manage it so when you change 
to first workspace, your desktop wallpaper will be picked from wallpapers 
group for that workspace. When you change to second workspace, it will be
picked from wallpapers group for second workspace. So you could have 
situation like this. You change to third workspace and you will get cartoon
desktop wallpaper (wallpapers group for that workspace consists of cartoon
wallpapers only). You change to fourth workspace and you will get abstract
desktop wallpaper (wallpapers group for that workspace consists of abstract
wallpapers only). I think you get the idea. Off course you can disable this 
feature if you just want your desktop wallpaper changes when the specified 
time (specified by you) has passed and does not change when you change 
workspace.

Wallpapoz application consist of two programs. First is "wallpapoz". 
"wallpapoz" is the program to make the configuration file. What wallpapers 
do you want to use? It just like that. So before doing anything else, run
this program first. The file configuration is located in $HOME/.wallpapoz/
.wallpapoz.xml. Although you can edit the file with text editor, I don't
recommend it. If the file is corrupted, then remove it first before run
"wallpapoz" again. Don't run "wallpapoz" if the file is corrupted.

"daemon_wallpapoz" is the "real" program it self. The program will read the
configuration file and will change the wallpaper if you change the work-
space or the specified time has passed (depended on your options in
configuration file). 

You can run the "daemon_wallpapoz" from "wallpapoz" program. 
You can terminate it too from there.

If you are happy enough, you can start automatically running this program 
when you load the gnome desktop by adding "daemon_wallpapoz" to gnome session 
start up program. 

Dependencies
-----------------------------------------------------------------------------
If you run modern distro (released in 2005 year and above) with default Gnome 
desktop installed, your dependencies should already be fulfilled. It needs 
PyGtk, Python Glade, PIL (Python Imaging Library), and optionally Python Gnome to function.

Installation
-----------------------------------------------------------------------------
Run "python setup.py install" as root to install Wallpapoz in /usr/local.
To uninstall, simply run "python setup.py uninstall".

If you wish to install Wallpapoz in another base directory, use the --installdir
option. Example: "python setup.py install --installdir /usr".
If you have installed with --installdir, do not forget to use the same option
when uninstalling.

Example installation:

    $ tar -xzf wallpapoz-0.6.tar.gz
    $ cd wallpapoz-0.6

Depending on distro, the next steps could be this:
    # su
    # python setup.py install
or this:
    $ sudo python setup.py install

You don't have to install Wallpapoz to run the application. 
You can run Wallpapoz from its directory anywhere.

    $ cd wallpapoz-0.6
    $ cd src
    $ ./wallpapoz

You can put wallpapoz-0.6 directory in your home directory or anywhere.
Someday if you want to get rid of Wallpapoz, just remove the directory.
